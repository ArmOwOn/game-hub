## ## Run Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. You'll have to create an account first.
4. Add the API key to **src/services/api-client.ts**
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the web server.

## Lessons Learned

This project really taught me how to work with APIs and how to handle searches and sorting. I got comfortable with API requests and how to handle them with useEffect, and I learned how to use the Chakra UI components as well.
